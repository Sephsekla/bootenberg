# Bootenberg

Bootenberg brings the power of [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and its layout grid to the Gutenberg editor.

## How does it work?

After activating the plugin, you'll see the option to add Bootstrap containers, rows and columns within the editor.


## Thanks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).
